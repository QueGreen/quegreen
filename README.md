I am currently teaching myself to code as I finish up Angela Yu's (Founder of [London App Brewery](https://www.londonappbrewery.com/)) Web Developer Bootcamp.

In 2015, I began teaching myself to sew (with guidance from my Grandmother & her mother). I currently handcraft custom clothes on the side.
