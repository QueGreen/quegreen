### Salutations, I'm J.Monet! 💻👋🏾

I am currently teaching myself to code as I finish up Angela Yu's (Founder of London App Brewery) Web Developer Bootcamp. At the beginning of bootcamp, I enjoyed UX, UI, Wireframing, immedately. Mainly because I noticed the similaritities between Fashion Design and Web Design! 
In 2015, I began teaching myself to sew (with guidance from my Grandmother & her mother). I currently handcraft custom clothes on the side.
